    <p>Version 1.17; Snapshot 21w06a</p>
    <p>In minecraft added new Caves! This is cool! </p>
    <p>New caves are very big! At they many water, ores and mobs! Mobs is very strong. Spiders, zombies and Skeleton spawning in the spawners at caves. </p>
    <p>In past snapshots added copper ore. It is made of it lightning rod and spyglass. Copper block can oxidize. I like this!</p>
    <p>Else Mojang added in Minecraft new blocks and materials. This is Amethysts. You can make a lot of things out of it.</p>
